# dius-takehome
A takehome challenge from Dius

It is a Java 11 App with no cli or GUI so an example is provided for expected usage. There are also tests which serve the dual purpose of example API use & verification. The tests cover the basics, i.e pricing isnt changed between total requests, scan order doesnt matter, deals actually work, the discount value is as expected etc... but as ever, there can always be more tests.

This is a simple checkout for a shop selling computer goods.
It has the concept of Products which are a tuple of SKU and Price.
It has the concept of Deals which provide discounts for various buying choices:
  * MultiBuy - e.g Buy 3 for the price of 2
  * BulkBuy - buy 4 get a discount on price for every item
  * Bundle - buy x get y free

## Caveats and Future extension possibility
The Checkout logic is very simple, all complex operations are passed into it. This allows easier testing and dependency changes in future.<br>
There is no concept of currency or money formatting however that could be injected in future very simply.<br>
There is no human readable output however a ReceiptPrinter of such could be added later.<br>
Product & Deals are created programatically however the Example project shows how external configuration is simple to produce and the Checkout would need no changes to allow for such configuration in future.<br>
